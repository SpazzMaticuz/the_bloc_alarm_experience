<h2>Alarm & Timer App (Flutter + BLoC Architecture)</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This project is a multi-purpose alarm and timer application built with Flutter and Dart, designed primarily as a learning project to explore and practice the BLoC and Cubit architecture patterns.

It provides a unified interface for managing:

  • **Alarms** — with local notifications for waking up, sleeping, or reminders

  • **Countdown timers** — with optional lap tracking for measuring time intervals

  • **Stopwatch functionality** — to measure elapsed time precisely

The project was intentionally kept simple and modular, focusing on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and reactive state management using Flutter BLoC.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

  • **Framework**: Flutter

  • **Language**: Dart

  • **Database**: SQLite (via sqflite and path_provider)

  • **Architecture**: BLoC / Cubit pattern for state management

<h3>Purpose</h3>

The goal of this project was to:

  • Learn and apply BLoC and Cubit concepts in a practical way

  • Improve on various concepts and fix mistakes in previous designs


<h3>Summary</h3>

Overall, the project demonstrates how a Flutter app can remain simple while using reactive, scalable architecture. It serves as both a practice ground for BLoC and a foundation for more advanced productivity or reminder apps in the future.
