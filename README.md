**Alarm & Timer App (Flutter + BLoC Architecture)
Overview**

This project is a multi-purpose alarm and timer application built with Flutter and Dart, designed primarily as a learning project to explore and practice the BLoC and Cubit architecture patterns.

It provides a unified interface for managing:

Alarms — with local notifications for waking up, sleeping, or reminders

Countdown timers — with optional lap tracking for measuring time intervals

Stopwatch functionality — to measure elapsed time precisely

The project was intentionally kept simple and modular, focusing on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and reactive state management using Flutter BLoC.

**Tech Stack**

**Framework**: Flutter

**Language**: Dart

**Database**: SQLite (via sqflite and path_provider)

**Architecture**: BLoC / Cubit pattern for state management

**Purpose**

The goal of this project was to:

Learn and apply BLoC and Cubit concepts in a practical way

Understand how to manage complex state transitions (for example, multiple timers, alarms, and countdowns running in parallel)

Experiment with local notifications, persistent storage, and audio integration

**Summary**

Overall, the project demonstrates how a Flutter app can remain simple while using reactive, scalable architecture. It serves as both a practice ground for BLoC and a foundation for more advanced productivity or reminder apps in the future.
